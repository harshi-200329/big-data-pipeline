UCI Machine Learning Repository
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/362/gas+sensors+for+home+activity+monitoring

*Rows Selected:*
300,000

*Columns Included:*
- id
- time
- R1
- R2
- R3
- R4
- R5
- R6
- R7

- Humidity

*Cleaning Steps:*
- Verified the dataset had all expected columns.
- Selected the first 300,000 rows to create a manageable subset.
- Checked for missing values in key columns (Temp, Humidity) and filled them with column mean values to avoid dropping rows.
- Standardized column headers to remove dots and spaces (e.g., "Temp." renamed to "Temp").
- Confirmed all numeric columns are stored as floats.

*File Name:*
Iot_300k.csv

*Purpose:*
This cleaned dataset will be used by all team members for:
- Data ingestion (Redis)
- Time-series storage (Cassandra)
- Data processing and modeling (Python)
- Cloud integration (AWS S3)
